# Ridge Regression Model
This project demonstrates the application of Ridge Regression for predictive modeling using Python's scikit-learn. It involves the following:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing data.
Modeling: Building a Ridge Regression model for prediction.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to optimize the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance with MSE and R2 score.
Requirements
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run ridge_regression.py to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Results
The model is evaluated with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score for prediction accuracy.
